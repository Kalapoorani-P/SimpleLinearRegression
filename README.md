# Simple Linear Regression With Numpy and Pytorch
The notebook demonstrates how to create a simple linear regression model using PyTorch and trains it on synthetic data generated using the NumPy module. The model aims to learn a linear relationship between the input feature x and the target y. Finally, it tests the model by making predictions on random test data.
